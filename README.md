### Posts/Copy & Paste content

Copy and paste from other sites can be troublesome. 

Reccommendations:

#### Paste as Text

Instad use "Paste as text" option in the editor:

This way you won't paste in any errant code.  

#### Moving Images

Moving images from other sites it is always best to:

1. Save the image to your desktop

2. Then upload the image using the "Add Media" button

If your post is looking wonky, I'd select all the content in the editor and DELETE it. Then start back at "Paste as Text" above. Otherwise you're sure to be pulling out your hair ðŸ˜º
