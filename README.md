Put your cursor where you want the footnote and click the "Add a footnote" icon:

# Copy & Paste content

Copy and paste from other sites can be troublesome. 

I recommend 
using the "Paste as text" option in the editor:

This way you won't paste in any errant code.  

For images, always best to 
Save the image to your desktop
Then upload the image using the "Add Media" button

If your post is looking wonky, I'd select all the content in the editor and DELETE it. Then start back at #1 above. Otherwise you'll be pulling out your hair ðŸ˜º
